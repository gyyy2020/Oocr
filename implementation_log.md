## Function 3: Automatically Recognize Text
- **Objective:** Use Apple's Vision framework to automatically recognize text from the selected image.
- **Files Modified/Created:**
    - `AppState.swift`: (Modified) Added `recognizedText` (String) and `isRecognizing` (Bool) properties.
    - `ContentView.swift`: (Modified) **Revised `performOCR` function for reliability.**
        - Implemented a more robust `createCGImage(from:)` helper function to prevent image conversion errors.
        - Added detailed error messages that are displayed directly in the UI.
        - Added an `.onAppear` modifier to ensure OCR runs when the window opens with an image.
        - Refined the UI to cleanly switch between a progress indicator and the text results.
- **Status:** **Waiting for verification.**
