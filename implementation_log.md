# OCR App Implementation Log

This document summarizes the features and implementation process for the macOS OCR application built with SwiftUI and Apple's Vision framework.

### **Function 1: Menu Bar Icon**

-   **Objective:** Start the application with an icon in the system menu bar, providing basic controls.
-   **Implementation:**
    -   The primary `App` scene was changed from a `WindowGroup` to a `MenuBarExtra`, which creates a persistent icon in the menu bar.
    -   The menu bar icon was set to a system symbol (`text.viewfinder`) for a clean, modern look.
    -   The menu contains two initial `Button`s:
        -   **"Open Image"**: Triggers the file selection process.
        -   **"Quit"**: Terminates the application using `NSApplication.shared.terminate(nil)`.
-   **Status:** ✅ **Verified.**

### **Function 2: Open a Picture in a Window**

-   **Objective:** Allow a user to select an image file, which then opens and displays in a dedicated window. The app should only show the menu bar icon on initial launch, not a window or Dock icon.
-   **Implementation:**
    -   An `AppState` class (`ObservableObject`) was created to manage shared data across the application, such as the currently selected image (`NSImage`).
    -   A `WindowGroup` with a unique ID was added to host the `ContentView`.
    -   The `MenuBar`'s "Open Image" button action was implemented using `NSOpenPanel` to present a native file dialog, filtered for common image types (PNG, JPG, TIFF).
    -   Upon image selection, the `AppState` is updated, and the `openWindow(id:)` environment action is called to show the main window.
    -   **Startup Behavior:**
        -   The project's `Info.plist` file was modified to add the key `Application is agent (UIElement)` and set its value to `YES`. This instructs macOS to launch the app as a background/accessory process without an initial window or Dock icon.
        -   An empty `Settings {}` scene was added to the main `App` struct. This gives SwiftUI a "default" scene that doesn't open a window, preventing the `WindowGroup` from appearing automatically at launch.
        -   When the user opens an image, `NSApp.setActivationPolicy(.regular)` is called to make the app behave like a normal application, showing its window and Dock icon.
-   **Status:** ✅ **Verified.**

### **Function 3: Automatically Recognize Text**

-   **Objective:** Use Apple's Vision framework to automatically detect and extract text from the selected image.
-   **Implementation:**
    -   The `Vision` framework was imported into `ContentView`.
    -   The `AppState` was expanded to include properties for the `recognizedText` (String) and `isRecognizing` (Bool) to track the OCR state.
    -   A `performOCR(on:)` function was created. This function:
        1.  Sets the `isRecognizing` flag to `true` to show a `ProgressView`.
        2.  Reliably converts the input `NSImage` to a `CGImage` required by Vision.
        3.  Creates a `VNRecognizeTextRequest` with the recognition level set to `.accurate` and language correction enabled.
        4.  Performs the request on a background thread (`DispatchQueue.global`) to keep the UI responsive.
        5.  In the request's completion handler, it switches back to the main thread (`DispatchQueue.main`) to update the `AppState` with the results or any error messages.
    -   The `.onChange(of: appState.selectedImage)` modifier on `ContentView` automatically calls `performOCR` whenever a new image is loaded.
-   **Status:** ✅ **Verified.**

### **Function 4: Add a "Copy" Button**

-   **Objective:** Provide a simple way for the user to copy all the recognized text to the system clipboard.
-   **Implementation:**
    -   A `Button` with a "Copy" label and a system icon (`doc.on.doc`) was added to the `ContentView`'s control bar.
    -   The button's action calls a `copyTextToClipboard()` function.
    -   This function uses `NSPasteboard.general` to clear any previous content and set the new string from `appState.recognizedText`.
    -   The button is disabled if `appState.recognizedText` is empty.
-   **Status:** ✅ **Verified.**

### **Function 5: Language Selection**

-   **Objective:** Allow the user to specify the language for text recognition to improve accuracy for non-English text.
-   **Implementation:**
    -   A `LanguageModel.swift` file was created with a `Language` struct to cleanly manage display names and the corresponding codes required by the Vision framework (e.g., "English", "en-US").
    -   The `AppState` was updated with a `selectedLanguage` property.
    -   A `Picker` UI element, styled as a dropdown menu, was added to `ContentView`. It is populated using the list of available languages from the `LanguageModel`.
    -   The `performOCR` function was modified to set the `request.recognitionLanguages` property to `[appState.selectedLanguage.code]`.
    -   An `.onChange(of: appState.selectedLanguage)` modifier was added to `ContentView` to automatically re-run the OCR process if the user selects a new language on a loaded image.
-   **Status:** ✅ **Verified.**

### **Function 6: "Close & New" Button**

-   **Objective:** Improve the user workflow by adding a button to close the current window and immediately open a new file selection dialog.
-   **Implementation:**
    -   `NotificationCenter` was used for communication between the `ContentView` (in the `WindowGroup` scene) and the `MenuBar` scene.
    -   A custom `Notification.Name` was defined.
    -   The "Close & New" button in `ContentView` was implemented to:
        1.  Call `@Environment(\.dismiss)` to close its own window.
        2.  Post the custom notification using `NotificationCenter.default.post(...)`.
    -   The `MenuBar` scene uses an `.onReceive` modifier attached to a `VStack` within its content to listen for this notification. When received, it calls the existing `openImageFromFile()` function.
    -   A bug was fixed where re-opening a window wouldn't trigger OCR. The fix was to clear `appState.recognizedText` in `openImageFromFile` before loading the new image, ensuring the `ContentView` starts in a clean state.
-   **Status:** ✅ **Verified.**

### **Function 7: Selectable Layout (Vertical/Horizontal)**

-   **Objective:** Allow the user to change the layout to display the text view either at the bottom of or to the right of the image panel.
-   **Implementation:**
    -   A `LayoutDirection` enum (`.vertical`, `.horizontal`) was added to `AppState` to model the layout choice.
    -   In `ContentView`, the root `VStack` was replaced with an `AnyLayout` container.
    -   A computed property determines which layout type to use (`VStackLayout()` or `HStackLayout()`) based on the `appState.selectedLayout` property. This layout type is passed to the `AnyLayout` initializer.
    -   A `Picker` with a `.segmented` style was added to the control bar, allowing the user to toggle between "Bottom" and "Right". Changing the selection updates the `appState`, which causes the `AnyLayout` container to instantly rebuild its content in the new arrangement.
-   **Status:** ✅ **Verified.**
